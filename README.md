# Calamity Witch

Top down survival arcade style game developed with Visual Studio and MonoGame framework in C#. Play as a clumsy witch who messed up a spell and has to get rid of monsters the spawned in the forest. Choose between three different elemental spells and use them against monsters of a specific type. A spell can either destroy them or enrage them, making them stronger.

I initially pitched the game prompt for an academic project from Januuary 2020 to May 2020 and worked with a group of 5 people to further develop and design the idea. The project served as a twist to the rock-paper-scissors mechanic seen in games by having a spell of the same type make an enemy stronger. This shown to have made the project more challenging to players as they couldn't randomly use spells due to those consquences.
